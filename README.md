# 💼 Lead Conversion Intelligence Dashboard

An end-to-end **Business Development Analytics & Lead Scoring System** built using real-world data to help sales teams prioritize high-quality leads and improve conversion rates.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In modern business development, organizations generate a large volume of leads but often lack clarity on:

* Which leads are most likely to convert
* Where drop-offs occur in the funnel
* Which channels drive high-quality leads

This project solves these challenges by combining **data analytics, machine learning, and interactive visualization**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze lead behavior and engagement patterns
* Identify key factors influencing conversion
* Build a predictive model to score leads
* Develop an interactive dashboard for decision-making

---

## 📊 Features

### 🔹 1. Business Analytics Dashboard

* Conversion rate tracking
* Total leads vs converted leads
* Source-wise performance analysis

### 🔹 2. Funnel Analysis

* Visual representation of lead journey
* Identifies drop-off stages

### 🔹 3. Lead Conversion Prediction

* Predicts whether a lead will convert
* Based on behavioral features like:

  * Time spent on website
  * Number of visits

### 🔹 4. Interactive Filters

* Filter data by lead source
* Dynamic visualization updates

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Type:** Classification
* **Goal:** Predict lead conversion (0 or 1)

### 🔍 Key Features Used:

* Total Time Spent on Website
* Total Visits

### 📈 Output:

* Binary prediction (Converted / Not Converted)
* Can be extended to probability-based scoring
